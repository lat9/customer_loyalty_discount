<h1>Customer Loyalty Discount for Zen Cart&reg; v1.5.7 and v1.5.8</h1>
<h3>Version 2.0.0</h3>
<p>Current support thread at Zen Cart Forums: <a href="https://www.zen-cart.com/showthread.php?226172-Customer-Loyalty-Discount" target="_blank">https://www.zen-cart.com/showthread.php?226172-Customer-Loyalty-Discount</a>.  This software is provided for your use under the GNU General Public License.</p>
<p>Current Zen Cart download: <a href="https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1917" target="_blank">https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1917</a>.</p>
<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
<ol>
    <li>This plugin requires <em>Zen Cart v1.5.7 or later (including v1.5.8)</em> for its proper operation!</li>
    <li>It's been testing on PHP versions from 7.3 through 8.2.</li>
</ol>

<h2>What it does</h2>
<p>This Zen Cart order-total module enables a store to reward its repeat customers with a <em>Loyalty Discount</em> on future orders, based on their previous order-history over a customizable timeframe.  Refer to the <b>Configuration</b> section, below, for details.</p>
<p>Some of the processing for v2.0.0 has changed from v1.5.1 of the order-total:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The <em>Loyalty Discount</em> is no longer subtracted from the order's sub-total when this order-total's sort-order is less than that for the sub-total.</li>
    <li>Determination of the loyalty period is now based on the actual days-in-month rather than a 31-day look-back per month.</li>
    <li>You can now provide a comma-separated <em>list</em> of order-status id(s) to determine which orders in the period <em>qualify</em> for the cumulative orders' values.</li>
    <li>The order-total now validates its <em>Discount Percentage</em> configuration setting when you save those settings.  If a validation issue is found, the order-total will not enable itself on the storefront.</li>
    <li>The order-total <em>auto-disables</em> if it detects that a coupon has been applied to the order.</li>
    <li>The customer message during checkout now identifies what portions (products, shipping and tax) are included in the discount.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>There are no core-file overwrites in this plugin, but you should <strong>always</strong> backup your cart's database and files prior to making any changes.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If you are <em>upgrading</em> the order-total from a previous version, I strongly suggest that you &quot;Remove&quot; the previous version and then &quot;Install&quot; the updated version.  Many of the order total's configuration settings now have additional instructions!</p>
<p>Copy the following files to your cart's installation:</p>
<ol>
    <li>/includes/languages/english/modules/order_total/ot_loyalty_discount.php</li>
    <li>/includes/modules/order_total/ot_loyalty_discount.php</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you've copied the order-total's files, use your site's admin's <code>Modules :: Order Totals</code> to install and configure, see below, the order-total's settings.</li>

<h2>Uninstall</h2>
<p>First, &quot;Remove&quot; the order-total module via your admin's <code>Modules :: Order Totals</code> tool, then delete the two files that were copied to your store's file-system.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>The <em>Loyalty Discount</em> order-total provides the following configuration settings:</p>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Description</th>

            <td>Enable Discount?</td>
            <td>Indicates whether (<code>true</code>) or not (<code>false</code>, the default) to enable the <em>Customer Loyalty Discount</em> order-total.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Sort Order</td>
            <td>Identifies the order in which this order-total is added to the order, if enabled.  Default: 998.<br><br><b>Note:</b> If you have configured this order-total to <em>Include shipping</em> <b>and</b> <em>Include tax</em>, make sure that its sort-order is larger than the like-named setting for the <code>ot_shipping</code> order-total.  Otherwise, the shipping tax will not be available when this order-total performs its calculations!</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Include shipping?</td>
            <td>Indicates whether (<code>true</code>, the default) or not (<code>false</code>) to also apply the discount to the order's shipping cost.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Include tax?</td>
            <td>Indicates whether (<code>true</code>, the default) or not (<code>false</code>) to also apply the discount to the order's tax.<br><br>If this value is <code>true</code>, the product-tax is always discounted; the order's shipping-tax is discounted <em>only if</em> the discount is to include shipping, as set above.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Recalculate tax?</td>
            <td>Indicates whether (<code>true</code>) or not (<code>false</code>, the default) to recalculate an order's tax-value as displayed to the customer, based on any deductions calculated.<br><br><b>Note:</b> Setting this value to <code>true</code> when the <em>Sort Order</em> of this order-total is <b>&gt;=</b> that for <code>ot_tax</code> can result in unwanted results!</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cumulative Order Period</td>
            <td>Identifies the period over which a customer's previous orders are summed to determine if their previous &quot;spend&quot; qualifies for a deduction, one of:

        <tr>
            <td>Discount Percentage</td>
            <td>This setting is the <em>most important</em> one!  Here is where you identify the discount for which the customer qualifies based on their cumulative purchases<sup>1</sup>.

                <ul>
                    <li>A 5% discount for a cumulative order-total amount &gt;= 1000 and &lt; 1500 in the store's default currency in the specified period.</li>
                    <li>A 7.5% discount for a cumulative order-total amount &gt;= 1500 and &lt; 2000.</li>

<h2>Storefront Processing</h2>
<p>This section identifies the rules by which the <em>Loyalty Discount</em> calculates its overall discount-amount for a <em>qualified</em> customer:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The order's current sub-total, <em>less</em> the total of any gift-certificates, is the initial <code>discount-basis</code>.</li>
    <li>If the discount is configured to apply to shipping, the order's shipping <em>cost</em> is added to the <code>discount-basis</code>.</li>
    <li>If the discount is configured to apply to tax:<ol type="a">
        <li>The tax for all products in the order, <em>other than</em> gift-certificates, is summed and added to the <code>discount-basis</code>.</li>
        <li>If the discount is configured to apply to the order's shipping-cost, the order's shipping-tax is added to the <code>discount-basis</code>.</li>
    </ol></li>
</ol>
<p>The <em>Loyalty Discount</em> determines the <code>discount-percentage</code> to apply based on the customer's previous purchases, as indicated in the <em>Discount Percentage</em> configuration setting.  An order's final discount-amount (applied to the order) is calculated by multiplying the <code>discount-percentage</code> by the order's <code>discount-basis</code>.</p>
